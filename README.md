This assignment is for my Web App Development Module
It is web app where the user can add albums. 
There are users but they are called listeners in this model. 

For the albums route this is the functionality:
Get all albums
Get one album by id
Find All in one album
Find by song
Upvote and downvote entries in the database
Add and album
Delete and album

For the listeners route I have the following functionality:
Find all listeners
Find listener by id
Find the listener by favourite artist
Upvote and downvote the listener
Add a listener
Delete an entry by id
